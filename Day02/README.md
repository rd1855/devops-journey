# ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Basic Linux Commands

Today, I performed practical exercises on **basic Linux commands**: listing files, navigating directories, and creating directories.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Listing Commands (`ls`)
`ls [option_flag] [arguments]` â†’ lists files and subdirectories in the current directory.

### Examples:
- `ls -l` â†’ long list format (permissions, owner, size)  
- `ls -a` â†’ include hidden files/directories  
- `ls *.sh` â†’ list all `.sh` files  
- `ls -i` â†’ show inode numbers for files/directories  
- `ls -d */` â†’ list only directories  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Directory Commands
- `pwd` â†’ print current working directory  
- `cd path_to_directory` â†’ change to a specific directory  
- `cd ~` or `cd` â†’ go to home directory  
- `cd -` â†’ go to previous working directory  
- `cd ..` â†’ go one level up  
- `cd ../..` â†’ go two levels up  

### Creating Directories
- `mkdir directoryName` â†’ create a new folder  
- `mkdir .NewFolder` â†’ create a hidden folder  
- `mkdir A B C D` â†’ create multiple folders at once  
- `mkdir /home/user/Mydirectory` â†’ create a folder at a specific path  
- `mkdir -p A/B/C/D` â†’ create nested directories

## ðŸ”¹ Practical Script
I created `basic_linux_practice.sh` to test these commands practically.
