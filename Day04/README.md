# ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

Todayâ€™s focus was on understanding the kernel, shell, and shell scripting, and writing basic scripts.

## Key Concepts

### What is Kernel?
The kernel is the core of an OS. It manages CPU, memory, devices and system calls.

### What is Shell?
A shell is a user program that interprets commands and talks to the kernel (examples: bash, sh, zsh).

### What is Shell Scripting?
Writing a sequence of shell commands in a file to automate tasks (backups, checks, deployments, etc).

## Tasks & Examples

1. Explain Shell Scripting for DevOps (automation examples: backups, health checks, deployments)
2. Shebang: `#!/bin/bash` â€” tells the system to use bash. `#!/bin/sh` can be used but `sh` is more limited.
3. Script to print a line:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge"
